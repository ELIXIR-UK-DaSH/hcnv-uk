# Exploitation of the datasets by the Galaxy Community. 


## 1.  Intergrating a Copy number variant (CNV) detecting tools into Galaxy. 

Despite the development of numerous CNV detection tools over recent years, only a limited number have been integrated into the Galaxy platform, with even fewer remaining fully supported and functional [Zhao et al. (2013)](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-14-S11-S1). 


The following compilation provides a thorough overview of tools specifically designed to identify heterogeneous Copy Number Variations (hCNV) in Whole Exome Sequencing datasets. Each tool’s name, relevant link, Galaxy platform availability, and maintenance status—whether actively supported or no longer maintained—are outlined to assist in the selection of viable options for integration and use within Galaxy.

[Galaxy Training Network Community](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/) provides a [comprehensive tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-from-scratch/tutorial.html) to guide readers through the complete process of integrating a tool into Galaxy, including:

- Creating a Bioconda recipe for a new tool,
- Writing a Galaxy tool wrapper, and
- Testing and deploying the tool in both local and public Galaxy environments.

This document presents a case study on integrating [CNVkit](https://cnvkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) into Galaxy, following the steps outlined in the tutorial above.

## 2. Benchmarking hCNV Detection Tools

Selecting a tool for analysis requires an understanding of each tool's CNV detection accuracy, execution time, and infrastructure requirements.

Our plan includes:

1. Conducting benchmark tests on the CNV detection workflow in Galaxy to measure runtime and detected CNV performance.
2. Comparing these results against a reference CNV workflow.

The reference CNV workflow is available through the [Genome in a Bottle](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/genome-bottle) project.

Workflow and tools/code are available at:

# Training and Dissemination

The preprocessing steps for CNV data (from quality control to mapping) are typically similar across CNV detection workflows, with differences arising in the detection step itself.

Our plan to develop a tutorial for hCNV tools includes:

1. Reviewing the input requirements for available CNV tools,
2. Creating a shared preprocessing workflow adaptable for different tool datasets,
3. Highlighting the tool with the most extensive preprocessing needs as a central focus, while introducing other CNV tools as alternatives within the workflow,
4. Providing links to further reading for detailed guidance on each specific CNV tool, and
5. Identifying CNV detection tools available both within and outside Galaxy.

Current progress can be found in this [tutorial](https://github.com/kpbioteam/training-material/blob/project34/topics/variant-analysis/tutorials/somatic-variant-discovery/tutorial.md), which uses Control-Freec for CNV detection. This tutorial could serve as a foundational resource for future tutorials on this topic.
